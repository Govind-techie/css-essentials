Media Queries - CSS

- Media queries allow CSS to adapt styles based on device characteristics (like screen size).
- Commonly used for responsive design to ensure layouts work across desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
- Basic syntax:
    @media (condition) {
        
    }

Common conditions:
  max-width   : Apply styles when the viewport is smaller than or equal to the given width.
  min-width   : Apply styles when the viewport is larger than or equal to the given width.
  orientation : Target portrait or landscape modes.

Important:
- Use relative units (em, rem, %) for better responsiveness instead of fixed px.
- Always design mobile-first (start with small screens and scale up with min-width).
- Keep breakpoints consistent and meaningful to your layout needs.

-> Helps to create a responsive website.

/* 
The .one class defines a box with fixed height, width, and background color.
These are the default styles applied unless overridden by media queries.
*/

.one {
    height: 100px; 
    width: 500px;                  
    background-color: yellow;      
}

/* 
This media query targets screens that are exactly 400px wide.
Note: (width: 400px) is rarely used in practice; 
      (max-width: 400px) or (min-width: 400px) are more common for responsiveness.
*/
@media (width: 400px) {
    .one {
        background-color: red;     /* Change box color when viewport width is exactly 400px */
    }

    h1 {
        font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; /* Change font family of h1 only at 400px width */
    }
}

/* 
Important Notes:
- Use (max-width) or (min-width) instead of (width) for flexible responsiveness.
- Specific width queries (like width: 400px) only apply to that exact width, 
  which is very restrictive and not practical for real-world design.
*/

/* 
This media query applies styles when the device is in landscape orientation 
(width is greater than height).
Useful for adjusting layouts or styles specifically for horizontal screens.
*/
@media (orientation: landscape) {
    h1 {
        color: aqua;           
    }

    .one {
        background-color: indigo;
    }
}

/*
Important Notes:
- Orientation queries are useful for tablets and mobiles where screen rotation changes layout.
- Use them sparingly, only when design changes significantly between portrait and landscape.
