   Grid Column Property in CSS

   - The `grid-column` property is used to control how many columns 
     a grid item spans across in a grid layout.
   - It works by referencing grid lines, not just the number of columns.

   Ways to define grid-column:
   1. Using start and end grid lines
      Example: grid-column: 1 / 3;
      → The item starts at grid line 1 and ends just before grid line 3.

   2. Using grid-column-start and grid-column-end separately
      Example: 
         grid-column-start: 2;
         grid-column-end: 4;
      → The item spans from grid line 2 up to (but not including) grid line 4.

   3. Using the span keyword
      Example: grid-column: 1 / span 2;
      → The item starts at grid line 1 and spans across 2 columns.

   Notes:
   - Grid lines are numbered starting from 1 at the leftmost vertical line.
   - The shorthand `grid-column` combines start and end values into one line.
   - Useful for defining precise placement and spanning of items within the grid.

.one {
    grid-column-start: 1; /* Item starts from the first vertical grid line */
    grid-column-end: 3;   /* Item spans until (but not including) the third vertical grid line */

    grid-column: 1/4; /* shortHand: grid-column: (start-grid-line) / (end-grid-line) */

    grid-column: 1/span 3; /* By default, grid placement uses grid lines. Using the 'span' keyword lets you define the span in terms of columns (e.g., span 3 means the item covers 3 columns). */
}

/* 
Note: These properties use grid lines, not column counts, to determine placement.
