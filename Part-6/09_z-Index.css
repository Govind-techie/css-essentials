/* 
Z-Index - CSS

- The z-index property controls the stacking order of elements along the z-axis (front-to-back).
- Higher z-index values appear in front of lower ones.
- Only works on elements with a positioning context (position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
- Default value is auto (elements stack in HTML order).
- Negative values are allowed (element can be behind others).
- If elements share the same z-index, the one later in the DOM will appear on top.

Important:
- z-index only works if the element is positioned (not static).
- Stacking contexts can be created by certain CSS properties (e.g., opacity < 1, transform).
- Be careful when debugging: a new stacking context may prevent z-index from behaving as expected.

The .box class defines the base style for all boxes.
It sets a fixed size and border for visibility.

The .one class applies a pink background.
Although z-index is set to 2, it has no effect because 
the default position is static (z-index only works with positioned elements).

.one {
    background-color: pink;        
    z-index: 2; /* No effect since position is static by default */
}

/* 
The .two class has a background color, is relatively positioned,
and moved upward by 50px. Since position is relative, its z-index (1)
takes effect, placing it above elements with a lower stacking order 
but below higher z-index values.

.two {
    background-color: aquamarine;
    position: relative;            /* Enables z-index to work */
    bottom: 50px;                  /* Moves the element 50px upwards */
    z-index: 1;                    /* Stacks above default elements (z=0), but below z=2 */
}

/* 
The .three class applies a darksalmon background.
No positioning or z-index is defined, so it uses default stacking rules.
*/
.three {
    background-color: darksalmon;
}

/* 
Important Notes:
- z-index only works when the element has position set (relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
- By default, all elements have z-index: auto (treated like 0).
- Elements without z-index or positioning follow the DOM order.
