   Grid Row Property in CSS

   - The `grid-row` property is used to control how many rows 
     a grid item spans across in a grid layout.
   - It works by referencing horizontal grid lines, not just the number of rows.

   Ways to define grid-row:
   1. Using start and end grid lines
      Example: grid-row: 1 / 3;
      → The item starts at horizontal grid line 1 and ends just before horizontal grid line 3.

   2. Using grid-row-start and grid-row-end separately
      Example: 
         grid-row-start: 2;
         grid-row-end: 4;
      → The item spans from horizontal grid line 2 up to (but not including) grid line 4.

   3. Using the span keyword
      Example: grid-row: 1 / span 2;
      → The item starts at horizontal grid line 1 and spans across 2 rows.

   Notes:
   - Grid lines are numbered starting from 1 at the top horizontal line.
   - The shorthand `grid-row` combines start and end values into one line.
   - Useful for defining precise placement and spanning of items within the grid.

.one {
    grid-row-start: 1; /* Item starts from the first horizontal grid line */
    grid-row-end: 3;   /* Item spans until (but not including) the third horizontal grid line */

    grid-row: 1/4; /* shorthand: grid-row: (start-grid-line) / (end-grid-line) */

    grid-row: 1/span 3; /* By default, grid placement uses grid lines. Using the 'span' keyword lets you define the span in terms of rows (e.g., span 3 means the item covers 3 rows). */
}

/* 
Note: These properties use grid lines, not row counts, to determine placement.
