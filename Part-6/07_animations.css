CSS Animations

- CSS animations allow elements to smoothly transition between styles.
- Animations are defined using @keyframes to describe style changes at different points.
- The animation is applied to elements using the animation property.

Common properties:
  animation-name             : Name of the @keyframes to use.
  animation-duration         : How long one cycle of the animation lasts.
  animation-timing-function  : Controls the speed curve (ease, linear, etc.).
  animation-delay            : Time to wait before the animation starts.
  animation-iteration-count  : Number of times the animation runs (or infinite).
  animation-direction        : Direction of animation (normal, reverse, alternate).
  animation-fill-mode        : Defines how styles apply before/after animation.

Shorthand syntax:
  animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;
*/

.box {
    background-color: red; /* Initial background color */
    height: 100px; /* Initial height of the box */
    width: 100px;  /* Initial width of the box */

    animation-name: identifier; /* Refers to the @keyframes block named 'identifier' */
    animation-duration: 1s; /* Each animation cycle lasts 1 second */
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;  /* Animation starts slow and speeds up */
    animation-iteration-count: infinite; /* Animation will repeat endlessly */

    animation-direction: alternate; /* Animation alternates direction on each cycle */

    /* shortHand */
    animation: identifier 1s ease-it-out 2s infinite alternate-reverse;

    /*
    Shorthand syntax:
    animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;
    */
}

@keyframes identifier {
    from {
        background-color: red; /* Starting background color */
        height: 100px; /* Starting height */
        width: 100px;  /* Starting width */
    }

    to {
        background-color: yellow; /* Ending background color */
        height: 50px; /* Ending height */
        width: 50px;  /* Ending width */
    }
}

/*
Important Notes:
- animation-name must exactly match the @keyframes name.
- Always define both start (from) and end (to) states for clarity.
- Use animation-iteration-count carefully (e.g., infinite can affect performance).
- animation-direction: alternate helps avoid a jump back to the start state.
- Keep animation-duration and animation-timing-function realistic for smoothness.
