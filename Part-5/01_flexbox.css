Flexbox

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is used to create flexible 
and responsive layouts.

Key Concepts:
- Container: The parent element where flexbox is applied.
- Items: The children inside the flex container.

Main Axis vs Cross Axis:
- Main Axis: The direction of flex items (depends on flex-direction).
- Cross Axis: The perpendicular direction.

Common Container Properties:
- display: flex; → activates flexbox
- flex-direction → sets the direction (row, column, etc.)
- justify-content → aligns items along the main axis
- align-items → aligns items along the cross axis
- flex-wrap → allows items to wrap onto new lines

Common Item Properties:
- flex-grow → how much an item can grow
- flex-shrink → how much an item can shrink
- flex-basis → initial size of an item
- align-self → overrides align-items for one item

Use Flexbox when:
- You want to center elements easily
- You need spacing and alignment between items
- You want simple responsive layouts

Note => It is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
