/*
CSS Background Image & Background Size

- background-image: sets one or more images as the background of an element.
  Syntax: background-image: url('image.jpg');
  Notes:
  - You can use multiple images separated by commas.
  - Can use gradients as background images (linear-gradient, radial-gradient, etc.).
  - If no image is provided, the element uses background-color.

- background-size: controls the size of the background image.
  Syntax: background-size: auto | cover | contain | <length> | <percentage>;
  Parameters:
  - auto (default): original size of the image.
  - cover: scales the image to cover the entire element (may crop).
  - contain: scales the image to fit inside the element (maintains aspect ratio).
  - length/percentage: specify exact width and height.

Notes:
- You can combine multiple background properties in one shorthand: background: [color] [image] [position] [size] [repeat] [attachment];
- background-size is especially useful when creating responsive designs to ensure the image scales correctly.

#bg {
    height: 200px; 
    width: 400px; 
    background-color: yellow;
    margin: 10px auto; /* Adds vertical spacing and centers the element horizontally */
    background-image: url(bgimage.jpg); /* Sets the background image */
    background-size: cover; /* Scales the image to cover the entire element, cropping if necessary */
}

/*
Note:
- background-image sets an image as the background; multiple images can be layered by separating with commas.
- background-size defines how the image fits within the element:
  • cover → scales the image to cover the whole element (may crop) 
  • contain → scales the image to fit inside the element (maintains aspect ratio)
  • auto / length / percentage → sets custom size
- Always provide a background-color as a fallback.
- These properties help create responsive and visually appealing backgrounds.

Note: 'cover' is generally preferred for background images as it ensures the image fills the element, looks cleaner, and maintains high visual quality.
