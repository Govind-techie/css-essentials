/* 
Pseudo-Classes in CSS

- Pseudo-classes let you style elements based on their state or position.
- They start with a colon (:) and require no extra classes or IDs.

1. :hover
   - Applies when the user hovers over an element with the mouse.
   - Commonly used for buttons, links, and cards.

2. :active
   - Triggers when the element is being clicked or activated.
   - Useful for adding click feedback.

3. :focus
   - Applies when an element (like input) is selected or focused.
   - Helps highlight form fields during typing.

4. :first-child
   - Targets the first child element within a parent.

5. :nth-child(n)
   - Selects the nth element among siblings.
   - Useful for alternating styles (like even/odd rows).

6. :not(selector)
   - Selects everything except the specified element.

Note:
- Pseudo-classes are dynamic and help create interactive, responsive UIs.
