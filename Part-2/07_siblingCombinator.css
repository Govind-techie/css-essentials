/* 
Sibling Combinator in CSS

1. Adjacent Sibling Selector (A + B):
   - Selects the element B that is immediately next to element A (directly after it).

   Example:
   h2 + p {
     color: blue;
   }

   This will style only the first <p> that comes immediately after an <h2>.

2. General Sibling Selector (A ~ B):
   - Selects all elements B that are siblings of element A and appear after it (not necessarily immediately).

   Example:
   h2 ~ p {
     color: green;
   }

   This will style all <p> elements that are siblings of and appear after an <h2>.

Note:
- Sibling combinators only work on elements that share the same parent.
- Useful when styling elements in relation to their nearby content.

/* 
This rule applies to any <h3> element that directly follows a <p> element.
The '+' is the adjacent sibling combinator, meaning the <h3> must come 
immediately after the <p> in the HTML structure.
*/
p + h3 {
  text-decoration: underline; /* Underlines the <h3> text */
}

/* 
This rule targets any element with the class 'answer' that directly follows 
an element with the class 'upvote'.
Again, the '+' means 'immediate next sibling' â€” both elements must share the same parent.
*/
.upvote + .answer {
  background-color: crimson; /* Sets a red background to the .answer element */
