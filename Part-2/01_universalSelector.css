/* 
Universal Selector (*)

The universal selector (*) targets all elements in the document.
It is often used for resetting default styles to ensure consistency 
across different browsers.

Common usage:
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

This helps remove unwanted spacing and makes layout more predictable.
Use with care, as it affects every element on the page.
