/* 
Descendant Selector
Used to select elements that are nested inside a specific parent element.
It targets all matching child elements that are descendants of a specified ancestor.

Syntax:
ancestor descendant {
   -- styles --
}

Example:
nav ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}

This will apply the style to all <ul> elements that are inside a <nav> element.

Note:
- There can be any number of levels between the ancestor and descendant.
- Useful for applying styles only within specific sections of the document.

.post a { 
    /* Styles all <a> (anchor) tags that are inside any element with class="post" */
    color: indigo;
}

/*
Using Class in Descendant Selector:
- This targets elements more specifically by applying styles only when inside a particular classed section.
- In this case, only <a> tags inside elements with class="post" will be styled.

Why it's advisable:
- Keeps styles scoped and avoids affecting similar tags in other parts of the page.
- Makes CSS easier to manage and maintain, especially in larger projects.
- Prevents unintended overrides and helps with better structure in modular designs.

nav a { 
    /* Styles all <a> tags that are inside the <nav> section */
    color: blue;
}

/*
Note:
- The descendant selector is written as: parent child
- It applies the style to all matching child elements at any depth inside the parent.
- Useful for scoping styles within specific sections without affecting the entire document.
