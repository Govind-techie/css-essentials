/* 
Attribute Selector — Notes:

▪ The attribute selector is used to target HTML elements based on the presence 
  or value of their attributes.

▪ It is useful when you want to style elements dynamically, without relying on 
  classes or IDs.

Types of Attribute Selectors:

1. [attr]
   → Selects elements that have the specified attribute, regardless of its value.

2. [attr="value"]
   → Selects elements where the attribute is exactly equal to the given value.

3. [attr^="value"]
   → Selects elements where the attribute value starts with the specified string.

4. [attr$="value"]
   → Selects elements where the attribute value ends with the specified string.

5. [attr*="value"]
   → Selects elements where the attribute value contains the specified substring.

Note:
- Attribute selectors are powerful for targeting elements like links, inputs, or 
  custom components in forms or navigation.
- They are especially useful when working with dynamically generated HTML or 
  third-party components.
