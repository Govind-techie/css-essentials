/* 
ID Selector
Used to select a single, unique element based on its ID attribute.
The ID selector starts with a '#' followed by the ID name.

Example:
#header {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

This will apply the style only to the element with id="header".

Note:
- IDs must be unique within the HTML document.
- Use ID selectors for styling one specific element only.

Note: It is recommended to keep IDs unique and meaningful, 
as it makes styling and maintaining the code easier.
