Pseudo-Elements in CSS

- Pseudo-elements let you style specific parts of an element.
- They start with two colons (::), but older browsers also accept one.

1. ::before
   - Inserts content before the element’s actual content.
   - Used for icons, labels, decorative elements, etc.

2. ::after
   - Inserts content after the element’s actual content.
   - Commonly used to add arrows, badges, etc.

3. ::first-letter
   - Styles the first letter of a block of text.
   - Used for drop caps or emphasis.

4. ::first-line
   - Styles only the first line of text in a block.

5. ::placeholder
   - Styles the placeholder text inside input or textarea fields.

Note:
- Pseudo-elements are useful for adding extra styling without extra HTML.
- Always use `content: ""` with ::before and ::after.
