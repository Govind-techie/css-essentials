/* 
Child Combinator Selector ( > )
Used to select elements that are **direct children** of a specified parent element.
It does NOT select deeper nested descendants â€” only the first level of children.

Syntax:
parent > child {
    -- style --
}

Example:
div > p {
  color: blue;
}

Explanation:
- This will apply the color blue to all <p> elements that are direct children of a <div>.
- It will NOT affect <p> elements that are nested deeper inside other elements within the <div>.
*/

/* Child Combinator */

div > input { /* Adding background-color <input> (child) nested in <div> (parent) */
    background-color: cornsilk;
}

/* 
Note:
In a child combinator, the selected element must be a direct child of the parent.
This means the child must be immediately inside the parent, should not be nested deeper.
