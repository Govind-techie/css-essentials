Q3: Create a list of technologies:
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, SQL, MongoDB, Java, C++, C, Python

- Change the display of all list items to inline to place them in a single horizontal line.
- Observe and explain why the bullet points disappear when list items are inline.
*/

.list {
    display: inline;
}

/* 
When list items are set to 'inline', they lose their block-level behavior.
Bullet points (list markers) are part of block elements by default,
so changing to inline removes the markers since inline elements donâ€™t show bullets.
To keep bullets while displaying horizontally, use other methods like 'inline-block' or flexbox.
